# Support
### HackUCSC 2016
A project created by Sarah Borland, Henry Pan, Huishi (Leslie) Li, and Karl Cassel.

## About
Support is a service to help those in need find support that is tailored
towards them.

## How it Works
Volunteers (known as Supporters) can sign up on our website and after
answering a few questions and being approved by the admin, they'll be
entered into a database where they'll be matched with people in need.

Individuals in trouble can message the service and Support will match
the Supporter with the individual based on the volunteer's strengths
and the individual's needs. Once there is a match, the service will
send the individual description of their problem to the Supporter who
can either decline (for example, they don't feel capable of handling
the situation) or accept in which a message will be sent to the
individual with the phone and email details of the Supporter.



## Interesting Tidbits
A list of list of list of strings appears in Python as
[[["String here"]]] and makes things both interesting and painful.
